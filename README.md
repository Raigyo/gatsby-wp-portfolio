## Stack

[gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental): This plugin is the official recommended way to use WordPress with Gatsby.

`npm -i gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`

Install and activate both of the following plugins in a live WordPress instance:

- [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
- [WPGatsby](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gatsby/)

In the *gatsby-config.js* of the starter you just set up, update the plugin options for gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental. Change the url option so that it points to your WordPress instance GraphQL url. This should be the full url of your GraphQL endpoint. Eg https://yoursite.com/graphql

````js
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental`,
      options: {
        // the only required plugin option for WordPress is the GraphQL url.
        url:
          process.env.WPGRAPHQL_URL ||
          `https://raigyo-dev.be/gatsby-portfolio/graphql`,
      },
    },
````
